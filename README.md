## Building

* **Architecture**:
  We are using MVVM architecture to build this app. The MVVM arch help clearly separate
  application's business logic from its user interface. Maintaining a clean separation between
  business logic
  and the UI help development process easier to test, maintain and evolve.

* **Framework and Library**:

- Retrofit: The Retrofit library is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java, and Kotlin,
  developed by Square. With the help of the Retrofit library, we can have access to a powerful
  framework
  that helps us in authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp

- Glide: The image loader library, it help control the app lifecycle, auto cancel when
  activity/fragment destroyed.
  Fit the bitmap to the ImageView's size to reduce application memory usage and more features to
  custom the image.

## Functionalities and Technical (Add if had additional time)
